# Release 0.1.6

## 0.1.6 (2022-05-09)

* Navbar and footer are not thinner than before, which makes them less distracting ;)
* They no longer stick to the top and bottom respectively. Scrolling on the page makes the navbar dissappear!
* Update live: New live update option! Setting the argument `update_live=True` removes `Submit` and `Clear` buttons. Any action updates the app right away.
* New spinners: Finally, Fast Dash now has loading spinners to indicate loading outputs. This comes in handy when executing long running scripts.
