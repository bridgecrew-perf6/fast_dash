Documentation: https://dkedar7.github.io/fast_dash/ Source code: https://github.com/dkedar7/fast_dash/ Fast Dash is a Python module that makes the development of web applications fast and easy. It is built on top of Plotly Dash and can be used to build web interfaces for Machine Learning models or to showcase any proof of concept without the hassle of developing UI from scratch. Simple example Run your app with three simple steps: from fast_dash import FastDash from fast_dash.Components import Text # Step 1: Define your model inference def text_to_text_function ( input_text ): return input_text # Step 2: Specify the input and output components app = FastDash ( callback_fn = text_to_text_function , inputs = Text , outputs = Text , title = 'App title' ) # Step 3: Run your app! app . run () # * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit) And just like that, we have a completely functional interactive app! Output: In a similar way, we can add multiple input as well as output components at the same time. from fast_dash import FastDash from fast_dash.Components import Text , Slider # Step 1: Define your model inference def text_to_text_function ( input_text , slider_value ): processed_text = f ' { input_text } .

A universal and hence the preferred method to deploy is to containers the applications and then deploy to a public cloud endpoint. Here're the general steps involved with the deployment process: Add a Dockerfile in the same directory that contains the main Fast Dash app module. Create wsgi.py Python script in the same path. Build and run Docker container. The recommended directory structure is this: root\\ - app.py - requirements.txt - ....py # (Other scripts that your Fast Dash app needs) With these steps in mind, let's see how we can deploy our simple text-to-text Fast Dash app to the most used cloud services. 1. Google Cloud Run Step 1. Get started with Google Cloud Get started with Google Cloud here . If you already have an account, proceed to the console and select Cloud Run from the list of services. Although not mandatory, it's highly recommended to get access to the gcloud command line utility . The gcloud CLI reduces the deployment down to just a single line of code. Step 2. Add wsgi.py Add wsgi.py Python script to the current directory. Modify it and add the following lines: from app import app server = app . app . server server is the Flask object that gets deployed. We need to isolate it from the rest of the app code so that we can instruct gunicorn in the next step to deploy it inside our Docker container. Step 3. Create Dockerfile Create a new file in the current path and modify it to reflect the following: FROM python:3.9-slim # Copy local code to the container image. ADD . /app WORKDIR /app # Install production dependencies. RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt # Deploy app using gunicorn CMD exec gunicorn wsgi:server --bind :$PORT Step 4. Modify requirements.txt Add gunicorn to the list of dependencies in requirements.txt . At this stage, the root path of your app should have this structure: root\\ - app.py - requirements.txt - wsgi.py - Dockerfile - ....py # (Other scripts that your Fast Dash app needs) Step 5. Deploy! \ud83d\ude80 If the gcloud CLI was correctly installed in step 1, simply run this command from the root of your project directory: gcloud run deploy You will be asked to enter a few different settings for your app. Read Google Cloud Run's documentation here to understand what each of them mean. Generally, choosing the following settings is acceptable: Source code location: Enter the directory with Dockerfile . If you are already in the project root , then this directory is preselected. Simply hit Enter . Service name: Type the app name of hit Enter to select default. Please specify a region: Choose the number corresponding to your nearest region. Allow unauthenticated invocations to: Select y if you understand and are okay with the repercussions. That's it! Google Cloud will build your app inside a Docker container and display the URL here once it's ready. The entire operation can take upto 5 minutes for simple applications. The build time highly depends on the complexity of your app and the number of dependencies.","title":"Deployment"},{"location":"User%20guide/deployment/#deployment","text":"Fast Dash apps can be deployed as regular Dash apps.
