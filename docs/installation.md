# Installation

## Stable release

To install Fast Dash, run this command in your
terminal:

<div class="termy">

``` console
$ pip install fast_dash
```

</div>

This is the preferred method to install Fast Dash, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for Fast Dash can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][].

You can either clone the public repository:

<div class="termy">

``` console
$ git clone git://github.com/dkedar7/fast_dash
```

</div>

Or download the [tarball][]:

<div class="termy">

``` console
$ curl -OJL https://github.com/dkedar7/fast_dash/tarball/master
```

</div>

<div class="termy">


Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

``` console
$ pip install .
```

</div>
